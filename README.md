## About RSGallery2
RSGallery2 is around since the Mambo days (2003) and is originally developed by Ronald Smit. Since then RSGallery2 has evolved with the Joomla! content management into what it is nowadays.

RSGallery2 is released by the GPL license and will be **free to use** (as in free beer).

## **joomla! 4.x RSG2 restart**

This version is intended for users who use RSGallery2 for the first time<br>
It will **not** care for RSGallery files and data from 3.x version<br>
This is handled by repository "RSGallery2_J-4-Upgrade"<br>
